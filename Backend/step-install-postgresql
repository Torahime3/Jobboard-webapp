Step 1:
Install the GUI Client (it is not the database ! it is just a visual interface for a better use of the database)
https://www.pgadmin.org/download/

Step 2:
Install PostgreSQL, the extensions and additions:
apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

Step 3:
Check if PostgreSQL is installed and of the daemon is active
service postgresql status

Step 4:
Start PostgreSQL using command line tool
sudo -u postgres psql

And check the details of the connection by typing '\conninfo' 
into the interpreter.

If there's "You are connected to database 'postgres' as user 'postgres'
via socket in "/var/run/postgresql" at port '5432'." That's good.

Don't forget to change the password of postgres
\password postgres
i've put "jobboard"

Step 5:
Now go on your GUI client pgAdmin 4
Then press Add New Server button and enter information of
the remote server

the name -> Jobboard-BD
and in connection parameters, 
Host name/adress -> 127.0.0.1
Port -> 5432
Maintenance database -> postgres
Username -> postgres
Password -> jobboard
