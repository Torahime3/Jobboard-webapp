# 💼 JobBoard 💼

## Introduction 📖
This project aims to realise a web site listing some job advertisements.
To make this possible, we needed to realise the following steps :
- Create a database (that will contains : job advertisements/applications, users, company...)

The main task is to make all the previous tasks communicate together.
